## Objective
To learn the basics of React
* Followed along with Fireship's Memento tutorial.
* Familiarised myself with React hooks, PWAs and deployment to Firebase.

## Structure
* A basic single page React.js application containing the Memento card game

## Retrospection
* In the future, may consider swapping out card images with custom designs, as well as some way to ramp up difficulty per consecutive win.

## Scripts

In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
